## Expected Behaviour

### General

- The navigation menu is fixed to the left for larger screens.

### Home

- The trending section should scroll sideways to reveal other trending shows
- The search input searches through all shows (i.e., all movies and TV series)

### Movies

- This page displays shows with the "Movie" category with a sort functionality

### TV Series

- This page displays shows with the "TV Series" category with a sort functionality

### Bookmarked Shows

- This page displays all bookmarked shows from both categories

### Authentication

- Click on the "Logout" button on the Sidebar to log out
- It shows a spinner and an overlay that prevents you from operating the app while it is logging you out.

### Settings

- On changing the password, a loader and overlay comes up. When the password change process is done, you are automatically logged out to log in with the new password.
- While changing other information, an overlay and spinner also pops out until the process is done and all changes are effected instantly. In this case, you are not logged out.

### Color Theme

- You can choose between light and dark modes.
